It's been a week @bentleysystems now. After going through a 5 months WFH internship, the office experience truly provides a welcoming ambience with someone to bug you. 

TLDR;
When you go on your first day expecting to be a smooth ride to the office but got into a f*cking crowded bus where you could escape without even getting the ticket (I didn't 😅). That's not it, had to stand for 30mins as there was no way(No OTP to check-in) to check-in to the office premises. No I didn't come back home 🤣. Really humble of the guard to come down and take us making us feel like some secret agents, LoL. 

The weird (and not) thing about Bentley is that they didn't offer any free food yet to the interns. So, making sure you eat home-made food or saving costs, LoL. If I complain this to my manager, she will tell "Please submit a help ticket for this and someone's gonna contact you from Arsalan's team 😂".

Initially, I was like I'm gonna enjoy talking and meeting new people in the office. And ofcourse this had to be ruined when no one shows up at office daily just not to miss their daily calls after they wake up. Bad luck but no idea why Bentley is just opposite to other organisations which like to hire females more and we being "The Boys" for now(Not sure if this made any sense).

Sadly I would've better loved a Mac 2017 instead of a 32GB-RAM wala dabba 🤷🏻‍♂️. Gave me a reason not to WFO daily.

The best intern benefit is when you can take 8 days ka free leave for 2 days exam 📚 just to make sure. Not gonna lie this is really helpful to take a break from work stuff and the urge to visit your college.

After a never-forgetting mentor like Atul, looking forward to have the same experience from dual-mentorship this time from Dhiman. Taught a lot apart from technical stuff which helped me for my college to corporate transition (Truly grateful to Atul Deopujari 😌).

It gets even more exciting when someone waits after your day one ends and your mentor tries to explain everthing in one day. :)

Thanks if you've come this far reading and I'm sorry if I might've made you waste a pinch of your energy for the day 😜.  I think this makes more sense than a "#Day1" photo 🙂.
